<h2>1.1 Basics of the Web</h2>
  </span>
<span>
<h3>Major Pieces of the Web</h3>
<br>Browsers make requests via the internet to servers
<br>Browsers- a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web
<br>Internet- the world's largest computer network
<br>Servers- computers that host the files that make up the web
<br> HTTP- the main protocol of the web; the internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your browser, and servers
  </span>
<br>
<br>
  <span>
<h3>HTML- HyperText Markup Language</h3>
<br>Heart of the web
<br>HTML is made up of text content: what you see, markup: what it looks like, references to other documents: images videos etc, links to other pages
  </span>
<br>
<br>
  <span>
<h3>HTML Markup</h3>
<br>Made up of tags-
<NAME>contents</NAME>
<br>Whole thing is the element
<br><b> Bold tag </b> -
<b> contents
  </b>
    <br> Contents appears bold
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
<span>
    <h3>Connect HTML documents to any other document on the internet by adding links
HTML Attributes</h3>
    <br>
    <TAG ATTR="value"> contents</TAG>
    <br> Anchor tag- <a> for making links<br>
	<a href="www.google.com">contents</a>
    <br>
    <br><b> Image Tag</b>
    <br><img src="url" alt="text">
    <br>Images don't have a closing tag
    <br> Void tag- a tag without a closing tag
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
   <span>
      <h3>Whitespace</h3>
    <br>Text on multiple lines put text on same line
    <br>break tag void tag

    <p> paragraph NOT void tag
    </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>
      <h3>Inline/Block</h3>
      <br>break tag - inline
      <br>paragraph tag - block
      <br> HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
      </span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span>   <h2>1.2 Creating a Structured Document</h2> </span>
       
      <span>The browser builds a tree like stucture of the page. Sideways triangles are an HTML element, each has an opening and closing tag. Everything on a webpage is actually in a box. Everything is in a box, regardless of how the shape appears on the webpage. The style changes the shape inside the box, border radius makes things not squares. A browser sees HTML as boxes within boxes within boxes...	 When programmers talk about the DOM(Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree like structure of a page. Class attributes are reminders of what's inside of the tags
      </span>

        <p>
          <span>
          <h3>HTML</h3><br>
          	HTML controls the "structure" of a web page<br>
          	Language of the web<br>
	Has specific syntax and rules<br>
	Basic word in the language is tag<br>
	Tags are turned into elements in tree form<br>
	DOM turns tags into elements in tree<br>
	Elements are created from the starting tag to the ending tag everything in between is content<br>
	Each tag has a name or type that defines what type of element will be created<br>
	Each tag can have attributes  with values<br>
      </span>
	
    <p>
     <span> 
       <h3>CSS</h3><br>
      	CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks)<br>
      	A language to define the style<br>
	Changes how elements look on the page<br>
	CSS gives HTML or the browser information about the style<br>
      </span>

<span> <h2>1.3 Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2></span>
<span>
<br>
CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. 
<br>
CSS styles allow you to avoid writing the same code over and over. 
<br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The C is the most important part of the phrase.
<br>
Most specific rules are applied to not just to a specified element,  but also all of its descendants. This idea is called inheritance.
<br>
Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index

Inheritance prevents repetition when writing CSS

<h3>Box Sizing</h3> <br>
  1. HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.<br>
  2. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.<br>
  3. There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.<br>
    1. Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.<br>
    2. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.<br>
  4. Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.<br><br>
<h3>Box Positioning</h3><br>
1. Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.<br>
2. Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.<br>
